# 🎰 Jackpot System Explanation

## How It Currently Works

The **Jackpot** is a special win condition in the **Slots** game.

### How to Trigger a Jackpot:
1. Go to the **Gambling-Hall** channel
2. Use the command: `elora slots [amount]`
3. If you get **3 diamonds (💎💎💎)** in a row, you hit the JACKPOT!

### Jackpot Rewards:
- **100x multiplier** on your bet!
- Example: If you bet 1,000 coins and hit jackpot, you win **100,000 coins**!
- A special announcement is posted in the **Jackpot** channel

### Current Slots Payouts:
- **💎💎💎 (Jackpot)**: 100x your bet
- **3 of a kind** (any symbol): 10x your bet
- **2 of a kind**: 2x your bet
- **No match**: You lose your bet

### Example:
```
elora slots 1000
Result: 💎 | 💎 | 💎
🎉 JACKPOT! You won 100,000 coins!
```
